# Unit-9-Pentesting-Live-Targets
Get hands-on experience with some of the most common security exploits through an applied hacking exercise.

For this assignment, you will attack three live targets, each of which is a slightly modified version of the same web application, Globitek. The three targets are therefore mostly identical. However, each target has been given a different color menu bar—blue, green, red—and each one has two different security vulnerabilities.

Your challenge is to attempt to find and exploit the vulnerabilities. The goal is to identify which two vulnerabilities the blue target has, which two vulnerabilities the green target has, and which two vulnerabilities the red target has.

# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Description: When executing a sleep based statement within the url, the database isn't properly secured, which then allows the SQL injection to execute and store.

Vulnerability #2: __________________

Description:

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description:  A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. When using an unknown username, the website returns "Log in was unsuccessful.". When using "jmonroe99", the website returns " **Log in was unsuccessful**.". The bold is an indicator that the username exists in the database. That being said, it allows for username enumeration using attacks such as bruteforce.

Vulnerability #2: __________________

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

Description: The website shows the ID of each user which is sensitive data. With data such as this being exposed, we can increment the numerical value to find users that may not be shown on the page.

Vulnerability #2: __________________
